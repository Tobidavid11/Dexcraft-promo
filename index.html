                <strong>Share Your Card:</strong> After you refer someone to Dexcraft, you’ll receive a designated referral card with a unique code via email. This card is your key to earning rewards. <br>
                <strong>When Your Referral Contacts Us:</strong> If the person you referred reaches out to Dexcraft for a project—whether it's design, development, or any other service—we'll ask them if they were referred. <br>
                <strong>They Present Your Card:</strong> Once your referral confirms they were referred by you, they will present your referral card with the unique code. This helps us verify that you’re the one who made the connection.  <br>
                <strong>You Get Paid:</strong> After the project is successfully completed, we use the referral card details to ensure you receive your cash reward. Your referral card’s code is linked to your information stored securely in our system, so we know exactly where to send the payment. <br>
                So, simply share your referral card, let Dexcraft do the work, and watch the rewards roll in!
